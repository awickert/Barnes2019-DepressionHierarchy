Abstract
--------

Depressions – inwardly-draining regions of digital elevation models – present
difficulties for terrain analysis and hydrological modeling. Analogous
"depressions" also arise in image processing and morphological segmentation
where they may represent noise, features of interest, or both. Here we provide a
new data structure – the depression hierarchy – that captures the full topologic
and topographic complexity of depressions in a region. We treat depressions as
networks, in a way that is analogous to surface-water flow paths, in which
individual sub-depressions merge together to form meta-depressions in a process
that continues until they begin to drain externally. The hierarchy can be used
to selectively fill or breach depressions, or to accelerate dynamic models of
hydrological flow. Complete, well-commented, open-source code and correctness
tests are available on Github and Zenodo.



Compilation
-----------

Be sure to acquire submodules either upon initially obtaining the repository:

    git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/r-barnes/Barnes2019-DepressionHierarchy.git

Or afterwards by using the following within the repository itself:

    git submodule update --recursive

Afterwards, compile:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    make -j 4 #Set to number of CPUs for a faster compilation

Run with:

    ./build/dephier.exe <Input> <Output> <OutGraph> <Ocean Level>
